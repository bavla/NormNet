# Resources

The file FB_resources.json was [created](http://vladowiki.fmf.uni-lj.si/doku.php?id=vlado:work:hn:cia#resources) from the Factbook data frame and converted into Pajek's two-mode network FB_resources.net. The set of nodes/resources needed some cleaning.
From FB_resources.net I prepared an equivalence template in the file resourcesEQ.txt and created (deleting labels) the corresponding partition in the file resourcesEQ.clu. In Pajek I shrunk the equivalent nodes and saved the (partially) cleaned network in the file FB_resourcesEQ.net.
