# Natalija

We read in R the data from the file `UssrX2018.csv` and export it as Pajek net file `UssrX2018.net`
```
> source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bavla/Rnet/master/R/Pajek.R")
> setwd("C:/Users/batagelj/Documents/papers/2021/normNet/natalija")
> C <- read.csv2("UssrX2018.csv",header=FALSE,nrows=15,row.names=1)
> colnames(C) <- rownames(C)
> S <- as.matrix(C)
> matrix2net(S,Net="UssrX2018.net")
```

We also compute in R the Jaccard normalization of the data. Here we have two possibilities:
* to consider the original diagonal (loop) weights - they count all collaborations (also internal). The diagonal weight for Russia is very large and most collaborations are inside Russia.
* to replace the diagonal weight with the row-sum of outdiagonal weights - it measures the collaboration with others. 
We selected the second option.

Last time we used Pajek to make this transformation (delete loops, vector/weighted outdegree, set diagonal). Here is done in R:

```
> Z <- net2matrix("UssrX2018S.net")
> J <- Z
> n = nrow(Z)
> for(u in 1:n) for(v in u:n) J[u,v] <- Z[u,v]/(Z[u,u]+Z[v,v]-Z[u,v])
> matrix2net(J,Net="Jaccard.net")
```

Based on Vlado code I try to create Jacard network in R (see the code below) and than I create dendrogram in Pajek with dissimillarity p=0 (Jacard.eps) and p=1 (Jacard1.eps).
Both dendro slightly different from your example (https://github.com/bavla/NormNet/blob/main/data/natalija/dendroJeu.pdf). In my case Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are together, in your — are’t. 
Could you please look on my network? What have I done incorrect? 
 
I have also prepared nets for another years, but I concern about it due to divergence with your dendroJeu for 2018.

```
source("S:/natalija/Pajek.R")
setwd("S:/natalija")
C <- read.csv2("UssrX2018.csv",header=FALSE,nrows=15,row.names=1)
colnames(C) <- rownames(C)
S <- as.matrix(C)
matrix2net(S,Net="UssrX2018.net")
# replaced in Pajek diagonals with out-diagonal sums
#Z <- net2matrix("UssrX2018S.net")
Z <- C
n = nrow(Z)
for (k in 1:n) {
  Z[n,n] <- 0
  Z[n,n] <- sum(Z[n,])
}  
J <- Z
n = nrow(Z)
for(u in 1:n) for(v in u:n) J[u,v] <- Z[u,v]/(Z[u,u]+Z[v,v]-Z[u,v])
matrix2net(J,Net="Jaccard2018.net")
```
