page 174 / Table 9.7 Abundance measures for 25 plant species on 17 plots in Steneryd Nature Reserve, Sweden

Table 9.7 shows the abundances of the 25 most abundant plant species on 17 plots from a grazed 
meadow in Steneryd Nature Reserve in Sweden, as measured by Persson (1981) and used for an 
example by Digby and Kempton (1987). Each value in the table is the sum of cover values in a 
range from 0 to 5 for nine sample quadrats, so that a value of 45 corresponds to complete cover
by the species being considered. Note that the species are in order from the most abundant (1) 
to the least abundant (25), and the plots are in the order given by Digby and Kempton (1987, 
table 3.2), which corresponds to variation in certain environmental factors such as light and moisture.
